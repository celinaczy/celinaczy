### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a linguist and English teacher with a strong interest in programming and AI. Coding for fun and to automate boring stuff.

Recently completed a 12-week program at Recurse Center in New York, improving Python programming skills and applying them to automate routine work tasks, and collaborated on a group project to develop a web-based multiplayer quiz application.

Currently, I'm working on projects from the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp course on Udemy. I'm about 50% in and so far I've covered
* Object-oriented programming
* GUI applications with Tkinter
* Web-scraping with Beautiful Soup
* Automation with selenium
* Use of APIs
