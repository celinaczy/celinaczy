### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Celina - a linguist and English teacher with a strong interest in programming and AI. Coding for fun and to automate boring stuff.

ðŸ”¨ Currently, I'm learning web scraping, automation, and Flask by working on projects from the [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Python_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.ROW_ti.7380&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_85724077624_._ad_535397279484_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-774930046209_._li_9067393_._pd__._&matchtype=&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIleGWk-3pggMVgJ1oCR1XSwCdEAAYASAAEgKt5_D_BwE) on Udemy

ðŸ’» Recently completed a 12-week program at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/about) in New York, improving Python programming skills and applying them to automate routine work tasks, and collaborated on a group project to develop a web-based multiplayer quiz application.

ðŸŽ“ I have a Master's degree in Natural Language Processing for which I wrote a thesis on *Sentiment and Emotion Analysis of the Black Mirror Series*.
