### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a linguist and English teacher with a strong interest in programming and AI. Coding for fun and to automate boring stuff.

Recently completed a 12-week program at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/about) in New York, improving Python programming skills and applying them to automate routine work tasks, and collaborated on a group project to develop a web-based multiplayer quiz application.

Currently, I'm working on projects from the [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Python_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.ROW_ti.7380&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_85724077624_._ad_535397279484_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-774930046209_._li_9067393_._pd__._&matchtype=&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIleGWk-3pggMVgJ1oCR1XSwCdEAAYASAAEgKt5_D_BwE) on Udemy. I'm about 50% in and so far I've covered
* Object-oriented programming
* GUI applications with Tkinter
* Web-scraping with Beautiful Soup
* Automation with selenium
* Use of APIs
