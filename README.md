### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a linguist and English teacher with a strong interest in programming and AI. Coding for fun and to automate boring stuff.

Currently, I work as a language instructor at a technical university in GdaÅ„sk, specializing in teaching Business English to Computer Science and Graphic Design students.

Recently completed a 12-week program at Recurse Center in New York, improving Python programming skills and applying them to automate routine work tasks and collaborated on a group project to develop a web-based multiplayer quiz application.
